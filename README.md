# Donate Spec
The missing donation specification for the open source community.

## What is this repository?
This specification details how to add your donation information to your NPM package. The first version was intended to be as broad as possible, and supports a multitide of platforms officially, but was created simply to serve as a starting point. I know there are incredible ideas out there that can help improve it. I'd like for the second version to have community involvement and be based on the needs and wants of the open source community. 

## What can be improved?
In the near future, it seems important to expand this concept to multiple languages. One option for packages that are not JS based is to have authors add [.donate.json](https://github.com/feross/thanks/issues/2#issuecomment-364490180) files to the root of their repository, and apply the same specification.

## How can I get invovled?
Fork this repository, modify the spec, and submit a pull request!
